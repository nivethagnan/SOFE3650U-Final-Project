# Iteration 2: Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality

Iteration 2 report pdf can be viewed [here](https://github.com/nivethagnan/SOFE3650U-Final-Project/blob/main/Iteration%202/Iteration%202.pdf)

## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

The goal of this iteration is to address the concern of identifying structures and to support the primary functions:

UC-1: Monitor App Status 
UC-2: User Authentication
UC-13: Register

## Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine

The elements of the system that will be refined are display order history, we will be refining this element to display order history from a longer period of time.

## Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers

| Design Decisions and Locations | Rationale and Assumptions |
| --- | --- |
| Create a Domain Model for the application | We must identify the major entities in the domain along with their relationships. In order to do this we must create a domain model for the system. |
| Identify Domain Objects that map to functional requirements | We do this to each distinct functional element so we can understand the modules in different layers rather than have them all be coagulated. |
| Map the system use cases to domain objects | We use this to identify major entities so it can be analyzed and deciphered with whatever use cases the system has. |
| Use Spring framework and Hibernate | Spring because of how widely it is used, we can use it in our SmartShop for the application development. Hibernate also works very well with Spring. The development team also agrees that Spring is a good framework to work with. |

## Step 5: Instantiate Architectural  Elements, Allocate  Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces

## Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions 

## Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal
