# Iteration 2: Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality

Iteration 2 report pdf can be viewed [here](https://github.com/nivethagnan/SOFE3650U-Final-Project/blob/main/Iteration%202/Iteration%202.pdf)

## ADD Step 1: Review Inputs

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Design Purpose | The purpose is to produce a detailed design to allow the construction of the application in the most efficient manner |
| Primary Functional requirements | The primary use cases we will be using will be the following:
                                     UC-1: Monitoring the Network Status
                                     UC-2: Detecting Faults in the Network
                                     UC-8: Displaying information
                                     UC-10: User Authentication |
                     

## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

## Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine

## Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers

## Step 5: Instantiate Architectural  Elements, Allocate  Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces

## Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions 

## Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal
