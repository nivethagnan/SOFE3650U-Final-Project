# Iteration 2: Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality

Iteration 2 report pdf can be viewed [here](https://github.com/nivethagnan/SOFE3650U-Final-Project/blob/main/Iteration%202/Iteration%202.pdf)

## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

The goal of this iteration is to address the concern of identifying structures and to support the primary functions:

* [UC-1: Monitor App Status](https://github.com/nivethagnan/SOFE3650U-Final-Project/blob/main/Project%20Progress/smartshop%20use%20case.png)
* [UC-2: User Authentication](https://github.com/nivethagnan/SOFE3650U-Final-Project/blob/main/Project%20Progress/smartshop%20use%20case.png)
* [UC-13: Register](https://github.com/nivethagnan/SOFE3650U-Final-Project/blob/main/Project%20Progress/smartshop%20use%20case.png)

## Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine

The elements of the system that will be refined are display order history, we will be refining this element to display order history from a longer period of time.

## Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers

| Design Decisions and Locations | Rationale and Assumptions |
| --- | --- |
| Create a Domain Model for the application | We must identify the major entities in the domain along with their relationships. In order to do this we must create a domain model for the system. |
| Identify Domain Objects that map to functional requirements | We do this to each distinct functional element so we can understand the modules in different layers rather than have them all be coagulated. |
| Map the system use cases to domain objects | We use this to identify major entities so it can be analyzed and deciphered with whatever use cases the system has. |
| Use Spring framework and Hibernate | Spring because of how widely it is used, we can use it in our SmartShop for the application development. Hibernate also works very well with Spring. The development team also agrees that Spring is a good framework to work with. |

## Step 5: Instantiate Architectural  Elements, Allocate  Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces

| Design Decisions and Locations | Rationale and Assumptions |
| --- | --- |
| Create only an initial domain model | The primary use cases need to be outlined and defined but only in an initial domain model. |
| Map the system use case | We need to identify the objects that are all in our system use cases. |
| Associate frameworks with a module in the data layer | As spoken about earlier, we will be using the Spring and Hibernate framework hand in hand and in doing so we will be able to discuss previous modules. |
| Decompose the domain objects across the layers to identify layer-specific modules with an explicit interface | This will ensure that all the modules are being supported and all the functionalities will be identified. Making sure that it follows CRN-3, where all the concerns are that the server load will be divided of busy to non busy across different time zones. |

## Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions

Figure 3: Extended Module View

The responsibilities of the the above figure are in the table below:

| Element | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Network Status | Gets network status from users via the mobile application. |
| Network Status Received | Receives the requested data from the user. |
| Performance Check | Checks performance from the user. |
| Performance Monitor | Monitors performance across all users. |
| Time Server Connector | Responsible for persistence operations related to the time server. |
| Event Data Mapper | Responsible for persistence operations related to the events. |

USE CASE 1: Monitor App Status
The following figure shows us the initial sequence diagram for UC-1. It shows how the user will interact and access the app and the app will work in turn its performance and efficiency to the users needs. When launched, a loading screen will occur, and then connect the user to the application which holds the database for all the stores that the user will browse through.

Figure 4: Sequence Diagram for UC-1

| Element | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile Application | Application that is being accessed by users. |
| Request performance | Send a server request while the user has launched the application. |
| Request server performance | Send a request to the network regarding the server. |
| Fetch performance | Receive the fulfilled performance requests. |
| Performance Summary | Get a summary of all performance inquiries. |

USE CASE 2: User Authentication
The next figure shows the initial sequence for UC-2. It shows the user authentication and how the user would access the application via logging in. This example shows the application being accessed by a mobile device which connects to the server which holds the database with their personal information. The data is then sent back to the actor.

Figure 5: Sequence Diagram for UC-2

| Element | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Login page | Users can send login info by putting in credentials. |
| Authentication | Users will put personal credentials and the system will check for validity of credentials. |
| Authentication message | If user can log in, will return successful login, and if canâ€™t, will return error. |
| Login Database | Will have login details stored if user needs it changed. |

USE CASE 13: Register
The next figure shows the initial sequence for UC-13. It shows the register processing the payment and how the users final decision will take place after ordering. This example shows the application being accessed in the application, and then processing the order. The data is then finally sent back to the actor. 

![iteration 2 figure 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80362439/144939711-cd56dba8-c6f0-45ec-b2c9-4e09af3ec62b.png)
Figure 6: Sequence Diagram for UC-13

| Element | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Order Page | User will enter order based on items in database. |
| Process Payment | Will have payment processed through the server and application and will request network validation while logged into the application. |
| Confirmation Process | Request recent order info as well as displays most recent order. |
| Register Process | Request order history, and order tracking and order message. |

## Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal

The designs made in this iteration had guided us towards an initial understanding of the efficiency and functionality and how it is used through the system. The primary use cases that were identified and the modules alongside them had proved to be very beneficial. As we had made our sketches and understood the design process, we had a new architectural concern, and will be added to the Kanban board as shown below.
