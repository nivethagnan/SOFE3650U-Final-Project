## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

QA-6  quality  attribute  scenario: 
A glitch can occur in the server database not processing any potential payment. The server will fix itself upon terminating the order and the application and then reopening it to clear cache, or will repair itself within 30 seconds.

## Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers
## Step 5:  Instantiate Architectural  Elements, Allocate  Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces
## Step 6: Sketch views and Record Design Decisions 
## Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal
