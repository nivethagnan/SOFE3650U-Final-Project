# Iteration 1: Establishing an Overall System Structure

Iteration 1 report pdf can be viewed [here]()

## Step 1: Review Inputs

In this step of the ADD method, we will review the inputs and show which requirements will be the drivers, as shown below. 

| Categories | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Design Purpose | The purpose is to produce a detailed design to allow the construction of the application in the most efficient manner |
| Primary Functional requirements | The primary use cases we will be using will be the following: UC-1: Monitoring the Network Status, UC-2: Detecting Faults in the Network, UC-8: Displaying information, UC-10: User Authentication |

## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
## Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine
## Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers
## Step 5:  Instantiate Architectural  Elements, Allocate  Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces
## Step 6: Sketch views and Record Design Decisions 
## Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal
